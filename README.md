## 📌 Summary
Nano.Azure provides a curated set of Azure services, infrastructure components, and deployment scripts designed to support 
**[Nano Applications](https://github.com/Nano-Core/Nano.Library/blob/master/README.md#nanolibrary)**. The goal is to standardize how Nano applications are hosted and operated 
in Azure by providing:

- Pre-configured infrastructure patterns
- Managed service first architecture
- Reusable deployment components
- Opinionated but flexible cloud setup

This repository focuses on leveraging _Azure managed services_ to reduce operational overhead, improve scalability, and simplify maintenance across environments. The key principles
in the Nano infrastructure are.  

- Managed-first architecture – prefer Azure-managed services over self-hosted infrastructure  
- Consistency over configuration – standardized setups across all Nano applications  
- Infrastructure as code – everything is reproducible and versioned  
- Minimal operational overhead – reduce maintenance burden in production systems  
- Composable architecture – services can be combined or used independently
